# Leaf Watch

**Leaf Watch** is an automated plant growth monitoring system, developed as a final year project. The system is designed to track the growth of lettuce plants using computer vision and machine learning techniques, providing valuable insights through a web application for better monitoring and decision-making.

## Features

- **Automated Growth Tracking**: Utilizes YOLO for object detection to track the growth of lettuce plants.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Integrates TensorFlow for machine learning and deep learning models to analyze plant growth patterns.
- **Web Application**: Frontend built with Flutter for seamless user interaction.
- **Backend Support**: Flask and Python power the backend services for managing data and model integration.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter
- **Backend**: Flask, Python
- **Machine Learning & Computer Vision**: YOLO, TensorFlow
